# Hello

Hello Everyone! My name is Jeremiah Canlas, I aspire to be a full stack developer but I am currently learning to be an efficient front end developer. I started learning how to code on March 2020 and since then I have been vigorously learning all the concepts about front end web development.

Since I started learning, I have learned how to efficiently write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although, I am still in process of learning more about Vanilla JavaScript before I step into a JavaScript framework.

Please feel free to send me a pull request if there is something I could improve.

Jeremiah
